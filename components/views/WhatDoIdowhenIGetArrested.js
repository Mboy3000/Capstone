      <h2>1st. Step Know Your Laws and Know Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        Getting Arrested, is not fun.And well,
        wheather you did something wrong or you are being wrongfully, arrested. It is important for
        you to know the process, and to understand your rights.

      <h2>Battiling Misconceptions</h2>
      <p>
        Many people have misconceptions about the law and the police, primarily due to Hollywood
        media. And often have the "well you shouldn't have been doing what your were doing to get arrested in the first place"
        or "If you didn't do anything wrong then just talk to the police to clear things up." and in a ideal just society that
        should be the case;however, we do not live in a ideal society. There are over 10,000 federal offenses that can land you
        in prison for more than 20 years, and the average American commits at least 3 of these federal offenses not being aware
        they are committing the crime.
