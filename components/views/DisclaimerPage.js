      <h3>The budgetting Software.</h3>
      <p>
        In terms of the budgetting software, it is based on the zero based budgetting methodology. And that is how
        All the calculations in regards to the out-put (what you the end user sees). Is derived from. Everyone's fincial
        Situation is unique to them, and it is strongly encouraged that you talk with accountants, fincial advisors, and
        finance lawyers, when doing your specific fincial strategy. The limitations of this tool is for a personal budget,
        and by no means sophisticated to the point to perform business strategy with.
