<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  Being a loser and degenerate all my life, I have always seemed to come up short of my goals.
  I have always been sick of failing. I hated being broke all the time. Usually, when a potential employer asks me what my greatest weakness
  are. I tell him how much time does he have. It is incredibly frustrating to be so disorganized, and broke all the time wondering were the hell
  all my money went. And how when I look at my life and see my fading strength and fleeting youth. Wondering were all that time went.
  After having many, many, many... many existential crisis. I figured I would do something about it and made TIM. A way to make budgeting, scheduling,
  and just general "adulting" easier. I made TIM in mind of all the things I wished I knew growing up, going through all the heartache and pain that I
  had to endure and lessons I had to learn the hard way. The expression "Time is Money " holds a lot more truths then what is usually expressed at face
  value.
