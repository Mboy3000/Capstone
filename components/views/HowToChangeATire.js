          <h2>Step 1. Get Somewhere Safe.</h2>
          <p>
            Being a adult when life is going right is hard. It sucks even worse when things go wrong.
            Luckily for you, TIM has you covered. While a tire popping or going flat is certainly
            alarming. the key is not to panic, and pull over to the side of the road, and find a
            safe place to park your vehicle. ideally in a flat area. In this situation it is ideal
            to notify other drivers of your dilemma by turning on you hazard lights.

          <h2> Step 2. Use your parking break</h2>
          <p>
            Once you have come to a complete stop you will want to turn your parking break on, and call
            whoever you need to call to inform them that you are going to be late.Once, you have put
            your parking break on to ensure the car dose'nt runaway, and you have increased your
            visibility to other drivers, and notified your stupid boss that you will be on your way.
            It is time to see if you are prepared.

            Before we go any further it is imperative to show that you have the right tools for the
            job. Otherwise the best course of action is to call for a tow and pray your insurance
            gives you adequate coverage without raising your deductible.(which they will but hey that's
            just part of being a adult). However, here are the items we recommend for you to have for
            any road side hazard situation.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Flash-light
              <p>
                You will want to have a flash light in case things get dark. It will also help you
                identify the areas underneath your vehicle.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>Gloves
              <p>
                Dealing with cars can certainly be rough on the hands, also it can be especially
                difficult to do emergency car work in extreme weather conditions,
                for example you wouldn't want to
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>Mat
              <p>
              Things can be a little, hard on the knees so it is nice to have. It is also useful in
              situations where you are in a snow bank or stuck in mud, to have something to give you
              that little bit extra friction to get out of being stuck.
              </p>

            <li>Rain Coat

                Car break downs, unfortunately, do not wait for the weather to be nice to happen.
                so it is Ideal to have a Rain Coat just in case it is raining in the event that you
                catch a flat or worse your car breaks down.

        you are going to want to loosen your lug nuts before lifting your vehicle. The Reason for
        this is because when the tires is up in the air it is nearly impossible to get enough torque
        to actually  loosen your nuts (always remember lefty loosey righty tighty). Also when doing
        this action both for loosening and tightening the tires you will want to use
        <em>The Star Procedure</em>
