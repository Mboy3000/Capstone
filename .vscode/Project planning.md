##TIM Definition statement

I want to build a application that helps with “adulting”. I want it to keep track of all the things that we tend to be to busy to keep track of and happen to lose it when we need it most, such as warranties, or maintenance we need to do on our houses and vehicles. I also want it to have information for “adulting” for things we need to know or at least should know but are too embarrassed to ask for help on, maybe things such as changing a tire, or tying a tie, or proper etiquette for fancy events.
