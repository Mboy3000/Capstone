      <h2>Step 1. Get Somewhere Safe.</h2>
      <section aria-label="Section about getting to a safe aria.">
      <p>Being a adult when life is going right is hard. It sucks even worse when things go wrong.
      Luckily for you, TIM has you covered. While a tire popping or going flat is certainly alarming.
      the key is not to panic, and pull over to the side of the road, and find a safe place to park your vehicle.
      ideally in a flat area. In this situation it is ideal to notify other drivers of your dilemma by turning on you hazard lights
      </section>
      <h2> Step 2. Use your parking break</h2>
      <p>Once you have come to a complete stop you will want to turn your parking break on, and call whoever you need to call to inform them
      that you are going to be late.Once, you have put your parking break on to ensure the car dose'nt runaway, and you have increased your visibility
    to other drivers, and notified your stupid boss that you will be on your way. It is time to see if you are prepared.</p>
    <h3>Stand by for the check list</h3>
      <p>Before we go any further it is imperative to show that you have the right tools for the job. Otherwise the best course of action is to call for a tow
      and pray your insurance gives you adequate coverage without raising your deductible.(which they will but hey that's just part of being a adult). However, here are the items
      we recommend for you to have for any road side hazard situation.
